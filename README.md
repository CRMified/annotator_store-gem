Annotator Store
===============

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/annotator-store.svg)][5]
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/itsmrwave/annotator-store.svg?branch=master)][13]

Rails engine to implement a Ruby backend store implementation for
[Annotator][annotator]. See demo application at [itsmrwave/annotator-store-
demo][14].

In case you were wondering:

> Annotator an open-source JavaScript library to easily add annotation
> functionality to any webpage. Annotations can have comments, tags, links,
> users, and more. Annotator is designed for [easy extensibility][1] so its a
> cinch to add a new feature or behaviour. Annotator also fosters an active
> developer community with contributors from four continents, building 3rd party
> plugins allowing the annotation of PDFs, EPUBs, videos, images, sound, and
> more.

The gem should be [up on RubyGems.org][5], the [CHANGELOG here][7] and [all the
releases listed here][8].

_Ps: Only developed and tested using a Rails app with a Postgres DB._


Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'annotator-store'

And then from the app root execute:

    $ bundle install

Configure your database credentials in `config/database.yml` and then run the
migrations to create the tables to store the annotations:

    $ rake annotator_store:install:migrations
    $ rake db:migrate

Then mount it in `config/routes.rb`:

    # Configures store endpoint in your app
    mount AnnotatorStore::Engine, at: '/annotator_store'

Now it should be ready for use. All the endpoints will be available at
`http://0.0.0.0:3000/annotator_store` in your app.


Annotation Format
-----------------

An annotation is a JSON document that contains a number of fields describing the
position and content of an annotation within a specified document:

    {
      "id": "39fc339cf058bd22176771b3e3187329",  # unique id (added by backend)
      "annotator_schema_version": "v1.0",        # schema version: default v1.0
      "created": "2011-05-24T18:52:08.036814",   # created datetime in iso8601 format (added by backend)
      "updated": "2011-05-26T12:17:05.012544",   # updated datetime in iso8601 format (added by backend)
      "text": "A note I wrote",                  # content of annotation
      "quote": "the text that was annotated",    # the annotated text (added by frontend)
      "uri": "http://example.com",               # URI of annotated document (added by frontend)
      "ranges": [                                # list of ranges covered by annotation (usually only one entry)
        {
          "start": "/p[69]/span/span",           # (relative) XPath to start element
          "end": "/p[70]/span/span",             # (relative) XPath to end element
          "startOffset": 0,                      # character offset within start element
          "endOffset": 120                       # character offset within end element
        }
      ]
    }

_Total_ is an integer denoting the total number of annotations matched by the
search, while _rows_ is a list containing what might be a subset of these
annotations.

If implemented, this endpoint should also support the `limit` and `offset` query
parameters for paging through results.

_Ps: Pagination with limit and offset not yet implemented. See [issue #1][15]._

Returns (example):

    $ curl http://example.com/annotator_store/search?text=annotation
    {
      "total": 43127,
      "rows": [
        {
          "id": "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
          "text": "Updated annotation text",
          ...
        },
        ...
      ]
    }

Development
-----------

There's a smaller dummy application created inside it at `spec/dummy`. This
application is used as a mounting point for the engine, to make testing the
engine on a Rails app extremely simple. This directory should be treated like a
typical Rails testing environment, allowing for unit, functional and integration
tests.

The current dummy app uses Rails 4.1.6 and Postgres as a store. It's my hope
that the gem works at least for all Rails versions `>= 4.0.0` (I don't see why
not) and other data stores that Rails supports like SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB etc
(since Rails uses an ORM) ... I guess we'll see how it goes.

You can see what the engine has so far by running `rails server` in `spec/dummy`
and then browse to `http://0.0.0.0:3000/`.


Testing
-------

You may extend the dummy application by generating controllers, models or views
from within the directory (`spec/dummy`), and then use those to test our engine
(I've done this already but feel free to add). Then use the rspec command to run
your specs.


```
=> Change directory to dummy application
$ cd spec/dummy/

=> Run all specs
$ bundle exec rspec

=> Run only model specs example ...
$ bundle exec rspec spec/models

=> Run only specs for AnnotatorStore::AnnotationsController ...
$ bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/annotations_controller_spec.rb
```

Automated tests are configured and set up to [run on Travis-CI][13].  Any push
or pull request will be built.


Versioning
----------

Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change at
any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is
incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it
changes as per [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].


Contributing
------------

Want to contribute to the code? First, have a look at the guide in the
[CONTRIBUTING.md][9] file for the workflow.

Then, here's some Annotator documentation to help you get up to speed:

* [Annotator Storage][10] API specifications.
* [Annotator Store Plugin][11] documentation.

In summary, this gem helps implement a store for the plugin to interact with.

Any code contributors should be [listed here][12].
